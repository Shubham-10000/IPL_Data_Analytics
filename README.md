# IPL_Data_Analytics
This Azure project builds a scalable data pipeline: Azure Data Factory ingests raw data into Data Lake Gen2, then Azure Databricks transforms it. The processed data is analyzed in Azure Synapse Analytics and visualized in Power BI. The architecture enables efficient real-time analytics and valuable business insights.
